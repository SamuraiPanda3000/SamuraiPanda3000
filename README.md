- 👋 Hi, I’m @SamuraiPanda3000. Most people call me Panda. (Only online.)
- 👀 I’m interested in science, science fiction, anime, cartoons, video games, programming, video game development, pop culture, old cd sample discs, and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning something. I don't know what. :P
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet. I just got here.
- 📫 You can reach me on Instagram @samuraipanda3vamps. Or here on Github.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have high suspicions that I'm autistic. I'm broke, so I'm not officially diagnosed.
