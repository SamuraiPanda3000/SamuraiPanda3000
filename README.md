- 👋🏾 Hi, I’m @SamuraiPanda3000. Most people call me Panda. (Only online.)
- 👀 I’m interested in science (biology, zoology, astronomy, paleontology), science fiction, anime, cartoons, video games, programming, video game development, pop culture, old cd sample discs, and more.
- 💻 I’m currently learning... something. I don't know what. :P (It's 3D animation and game development.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing yet. I just got here.
- 📫 You can reach me on Instagram @samuraipanda3vamps or in the links in my linktree.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- 🔢 Age: 19
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have high suspicions that I'm autistic and have ADHD. However, I'm broke, so I'm not officially diagnosed.
